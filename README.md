# Homework (Portfolio Page)
# Porfolio

## Description 

This project has started during my BootCamp coding course from UT Austin. The whole goal of having a webpage to showcase a professional portfolio is to make it easier for companies and recruiters to find more information about professional skills and knowledge and improve hiring rates.

This project was developed using HTML and CSS, and it's divided into three pages. The "about me" (also homepage), the "portfolio" page, and the "contact" page.

The "about me" page has a quick introduction to my experience and a professional picture of me. The portfolio page illustrates a few of my projects, along with my career as a marketer. Last, there is the contact page with a form where people can contact me through email.

## Features

### About Me
The project has a static HTML page as the homepage with an image inserted on it. The image floats by the side of the paragraph, talking about me.

The menu on the top was built using lists for every link to the other pages and also to the name, which has different class from the other lists so I could highlight it in a different format.

The test is inside div tags so we could apply all formats that it has now.

### Contact
The contact page has the same menu and footer as the homepage, but instead of text and image, it has the forms to capture the user's message when contacting me.
