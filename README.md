Homework 2 - Responsive Website using Bootstrap


#1 About Me

The 'About Me' was used based on the bootstrap grid and using its responsive navigation bar.


The system of containers, columns, and rows (with sub rows and sub-columns) was utilized to have the right margins on the sides (for the navigation bar and the rest of the content).

The navigation bar from bootstrap becomes a sandwish menu when reduced to mobile size.

The <p> tags increase the font sizes using Media Query for smaller devices.


#2 Contact

The contact page kept the same menu and footer from the 'About Me' page and three forms were included, one for email and two form areas for text, name and message.

It's important to mention that all three pages used the wrap just below the bodey to keep high 100% and include all div's needed to make the footer sticky.

#3 Portfolio

The Portfolio page is using a flexwrap inside the row and different from the other two pages, therefore it does not use columns in the whiteblock.

The images are created using cards from Bootstrap.
